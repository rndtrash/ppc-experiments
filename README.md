# Building

 1. Install kpartx, hfsplus tools with mkfs.hfsplus program and GCC with Binutils for PPC
 2. Run `make`

# To all the rights owners

At this point, I'm just kit-bashing random snippets from the Internet,
so please forgive me if I stole your code. I promise to replace it
with the original code as soon as I get this thing working.

Thank you for your understanding.
